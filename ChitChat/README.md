# Chit Chat
(During 18th January 2020 - This is final version of a 2 year project called Cyberly)<br>
Built an android application using the Reverie technologies for language API to prevent cyber bullying by analysing the sentiments of the chats in the chat groups.<br>
Used the Reverie language API for:<br>
1) Text to Speech conversion<br>
2) Language translation

Other backend features of the app:
 - Uses IBM Watson API for dataset and accurate sentimental analysis
 - Backend uses Machine Learning to analyze sentiments
 - Simple feature - If the sentiment is negative, it gets censored, else it goes
 - Live chat analysis between two people
 - Works for English and all regional languages
 - All words are analyzed and stored on Firebase/Cloud to make it dynamic.
 -Other simulations include a web extension, twitter bot and a simple timeline based app.
