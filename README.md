# Cyberly
To create a plugin to the existing social media platforms in the form of an anti-cyberbullying API.

This repo contains the final version of the app that is used to prevent cyberbullying.

(During Reverie Language Hackathon -> 18th January 2020)
Built an android application using the Reverie language hackathon to prevent cyber bullying by analysing the sentiments of the chats in the chat groups.
Used the Reverie language API for:

Text to Speech conversion
Language translation


Other backend features of the app:
 - Uses IBM Watson API for dataset and accurate sentimental analysis
 - Backend uses Machine Learning to analyze sentiments
 - Simple feature - If the sentiment is negative, it gets censored, else it goes
 - Live chat analysis between two people
 - Works for English and all regional languages
 - All words are analyzed and stored on Firebase/Cloud to make it dynamic.
 -Other simulations include a web extension, twitter bot and a simple timeline based app.
